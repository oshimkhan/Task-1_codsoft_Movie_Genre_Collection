Introduction

The Movie Genre Classification project is designed to classify movies into genres using machine learning techniques. By analyzing movie descriptions, the model predicts whether a movie falls into categories such as Action, Comedy, Drama, etc. This project was developed as part of an internship task at CodSoft.

Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

data/: Contains the datasets used for training and testing.
src/: Holds the source code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
notebooks/: Includes Jupyter Notebooks with detailed explanations and code execution.
models/: Stores the trained machine learning models.
README.md: Provides an overview and documentation for the project.
requirements.txt: Lists the dependencies required to run the project.
Dataset

The training dataset consists of movie descriptions along with their corresponding genres. The testing dataset includes movie descriptions without genre labels, which the model must predict. Datasets are preprocessed to handle missing values, convert text to numerical format, and split into training and testing sets.

Technologies Used

This project was developed using the following technologies:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Scikit-learn for machine learning
Pandas for data manipulation
Matplotlib for data visualization
NLTK for natural language processing
Tools:
Jupyter Notebook for code execution and analysis
Git for version control
Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/oshimkhan/movie-genre-classification.git
cd movie-genre-classification
Install the required Python packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Usage

To use the project, follow the steps below:

Open the Jupyter Notebook in the notebooks/ directory.
Run the notebook cells sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and make predictions.
The final section of the notebook will display the predictions and evaluation metrics.
Results

The model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test set. Below are some key results:

Confusion Matrix: Illustrates the performance of the classification model.
Classification Report: Provides precision, recall, and F1-score for each genre.
Sample Predictions: Shows examples of movie descriptions along with the predicted genres.
